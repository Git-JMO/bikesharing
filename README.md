## Overview of the statistical analysis:
   * The purpose of this statistical analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. For this analysis we first used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, we leveraged tableau to create various visualizations that were compiled into a story comprised of two different dashboards. This will undoubtedly make presenting the data much easier and will tell the full story we want to portray. Morevoer, by using Tableau we were able to show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week and more! Below is the story we compiled along with an explanation. 

## Results:
   * As mentioned previously, our story is comprised of two dashboards. The first dashboard provides an overall analysis of citibike data while the second dashboard focuses solely on Gender. In order to make it easier for our audience to follow along with our presentation, each visualization/graph was given a letter. Our explanation(s) for our graphics will reference these letters as well. 
     * Citi Bike User Analysis: Our first analysis was concentrated on bike usage as this will help give investors an idea how long bikeshares are used and during what time. See below for our first story point.
         ![User Analysis](Story/User_Analysis_Dash2.png)
       * Referencing Graphic [A], trip duration for all citi bike customers is generally between 20-40 minutes and most certainly under an hour. Moreover, referencing image [B], we can see that customers likely use citi bikes to commute to and from work due to the concentration of activity during 6-9am and 4-7pm) on weekdays. However, on weekends, activity is evenly spread during daylight hours.
